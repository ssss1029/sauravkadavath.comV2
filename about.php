                            <p>Hey there! I'm an Electrical Engineering &amp; Computer Science maor at UC Berkeley (possibly also a math minor; we'll see I guess). I'm using this website as a way for to keep track of all the problems that I encounter on my compuuting adventures - and hopefully it also helps out anyone who is trying to do some similar stuff.</p>
                            <p>I'll try my best to keep all of my posts simple and easy to follow so that they're accessible to everyone. Shoot me a message if you have any questions or comments about anything that you find here.</p>
                            <h3>Current and Past projects</h3>
                            <p>Currently, I'm managing a project at <a href="http://www.codebase.berkeley.edu">Codebase @ Berkeley</a>. We're making some scalable queueing infrastructure on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> for a startup here in the Bay Area. I'm also working on a project that I'm going to call <a href="newssight.php">NewsSight</a> for now. You can take a look the source code on my <a href="https://github.com/ssss1029">GitHub</a>.</p>
