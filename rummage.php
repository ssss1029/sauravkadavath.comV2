                            <p>The inspiration for Rummage came to me when I began thinking of when I noticed how websites were getting more and more personal and dynamic based on the user viewing the page. For example, we have our own personal YouTube homepages (everyone has a different set of vidoes that shows up at their home page). Interestingly, there was not much personalization when it came to search engines. In comes Rummage, which is designed to piggyback on Google searches, and in addition to normal web results that Google would return, Rummage would also add in results from users' Box, Dropbox, or GMail accounts. </p>
                            <p>Rummage started off as a super barebones Chrome Application that I began developing at a hackathon back when I has a junior in high school. I worked with a <a href="http://anuragpapolu.github.io/">partner</a>, and although we didn't finish the application in the allotted 24 hours, I decided to keep working at the idea in my spare time. My senior year in high school, I ended up redoing the entire project for fun, and decided to put it up on the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rummage/pahcjlpnciigaejakjnndfmmnppihhmg?hl=en"> Chrome Store </a>.</p>
